# Theming

Kiln ships a fresh, responsive default theme as a package resource: light/dark
colour schemes, a sidebar nav, an on-page table of contents, and search. You can
tweak it with options, or replace any part with your own templates.

## Tweaking the default theme

```swift
theme: .default(
    palette: .autoLightDark(primary: .black, accent: .blue),
    logo: "assets/logo.svg",
    favicons: [
        .init(type: .svg, path: "assets/logo.svg"),
        .init(type: .png(.x16)),
    ],
    fonts: .init(text: "Inter", code: "JetBrains Mono"),
    features: [.backToTop, .searchHighlight]
)
```

| Option     | Purpose                                                                                                     | Default values                          |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `palette`  | `Palette` with `primary`/`accent` `Color`s and a default mode.                                              | `.auto`/`.light`/`.dark`                |
| `logo`     | Header logo (content-relative path).                                                                        | none                                    |
| `favicons` | `.svg` for modern browsers, `.ico\|.png(.x16\|.x32)` for most browsers, `.png(.x180)` for apple-touch-icon. | path : assets/favicon\[-\(size)\].(ext) |
| `fonts`    | `Fonts(text:code:)` for body and code text.                                                                 |                                         |
| `features` | Opt-in extras: `.searchSuggest`, `.searchHighlight`, `.navigationTabs`, `.backToTop`.                       | `.searchSuggest`, `.searchHighlight`    |

`Color` has presets (`.black`, `.blue`, `.indigo`, …) or accepts any CSS string
via `Color("#2f6feb")`.

## Bringing your own templates

To customise the markup, point Kiln at a directory of your own
[Leaf](https://github.com/vapor/leaf-kit) templates and assets:

```swift
theme: .custom(directory: "Theme")
```

Templates resolve from **your directory first** and fall back to the bundled
theme, so you only override what you need. The theme is split into small
partials:

```
Theme/
├── templates/
│   ├── base.leaf            # overall page shell (<head>, header, layout, scripts)
│   ├── page.leaf            # a standard documentation page
│   ├── home.leaf            # the home page
│   ├── 404.leaf             # the error page
│   └── partials/
│       ├── header.leaf
│       ├── footer.leaf
│       ├── nav-tree.leaf
│       ├── toc.leaf
│       ├── search.leaf
│       ├── language-switcher.leaf
│       └── social-icons.leaf
├── css/
└── js/
```

## Sharing templates across sites

If several sites share the same look — a common header, footer, and cards — you
don't want to copy those templates into every project. Ship them once from a
shared Swift package as a bundled resource, then pull them in as a **shared theme
layer**.

In the shared package, bundle a theme directory (with a `templates/` folder) as a
resource and expose its URL:

```swift
// Package.swift
.target(name: "DesignTheme", resources: [.copy("Theme")])

// DesignTheme.swift
public enum DesignTheme {
    public static var directory: URL {
        Bundle.module.url(forResource: "Theme", withExtension: nil)!
    }
}
```

Then each site lists it in `sharedLayers`:

```swift
theme: .custom(directory: "Theme", sharedLayers: [DesignTheme.directory])
```

Templates now resolve in order: **your site's `Theme/` → the shared layer(s) →
Kiln's bundled default**. So a site overrides anything locally, falls back to the
shared design for common partials, and falls back to Kiln's default for the rest.
`sharedLayers` also works on `.default(sharedLayers:)` if you don't have a local
theme directory. Assets (`css`/`js`) follow the same layering, with later layers
overriding earlier ones.

## Template context

Templates receive a context with `site`, `page`, `nav`, `language`, `languages`,
`strings`, `customStrings`, and `searchIndexURL`. The rendered page body is
injected with `#unsafeHTML(page.content)`.

`strings` holds Kiln's localised UI strings for the current language — the search
box, navigation/footer labels, error-page text, and so on — e.g.
`#(strings.previousPage)` or `#(strings.home)`. `customStrings` holds your own
theme-defined strings; rather than reaching into it directly, look strings up
with the **`#localise("key")`** tag, which resolves against the current language and
falls back to the default language:

```leaf
<p class="tagline">#localise("tagline")</p>
```

See [Content & Localisation](content-and-localisation.md) for how to define both
sets of strings per language.

!!! tip "Per-page templates"
    A page can opt into a different template via the `template` front-matter key
    (see [Markdown](markdown.md)) — handy for a landing page or a differently
    laid-out reference.

## Extra CSS / JS

For small additions you don't need a full custom theme — just add stylesheets or
scripts (content-relative paths):

```swift
extraCSS: ["assets/custom.css"],
extraJavaScript: ["assets/custom.js"]
```
